Chrome Extension to show a notification when an email arrives in MS Office Online

A tab needs to be open(no need to be the currently viewed tab) with the email view for this to work

A work in progress, but the notification functionality works. Has some unwanted code there too, because I was learning chrome extension development while doing it

Depends on the DOM structure of the page, so can break if the structure changes
